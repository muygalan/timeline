> **January 28th, 2019**

Inbetween training my replacement at my old job and frantically selling/discarding furniture, January was an extremely stressful month for me. I set a personal deadline to gut my entire studio apartment before the end of the month. 

With the help of two amazing close friends who helped me clean, sell, pack, and move all my belongings, I managed to leave my apartment in tip-top shape. 

_(My landlord was also being a dick this day, so I stayed overnight at my friend's place to meet with him the next morning.)_
