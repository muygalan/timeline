I said goodbye to my friend and thanked her for her hospitality for letting me crash at her place.

I met with my landlord who inspected my apartment and handed me my rent deposit check. I immediately went to cash the check, deposited the funds into my own account, and shopped for snacks/supplies for my the long road trip ahead. 

With my Honda Accord filled to the brim with all my belongings, I set for I-95 North and drove for 7 hours. I stopped in South Carolina and slept over at a Days Inn.
