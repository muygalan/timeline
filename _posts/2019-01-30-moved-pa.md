I woke up to a brisk 28 degrees in Manning, SC. Not like the typical 75+ weather I'm used to in South Florida.

The journey continued for another 10 hour solo drive until I made it back to my destination. I was welcomed by family members who helped transfer the items from my car into the house. 

It was snowy and cold as fuck.
