After working for my [employer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/auction-packages/about/) for nearly 4 years, I called my boss on New Year's Eve and formally submitted my 3-week notice. 

He requested more time to hire a replacement that I could train. I obliged and gave him nearly 4 weeks instead.
